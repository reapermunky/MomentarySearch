# MomentarySearch

MomentarySearch is an ephemeral AI assistant that provides instant, context-aware answers by retrieving and processing real-time web information. It leverages live search results to deliver up-to-the-minute accuracy, without storing user data or retaining long-term memory.

## Note:
MomentarySearch is not just a lightweight search assistant. It represents an alternate model for AI itself - ephemeral, stateless, and privacy-native by architecture. In a world increasingly driven by centralized, memory-hoarding models, MomentarySearch demonstrates that real-time intelligence can be achieved without surveillance, without bloat, and without permanent data retention. This is a small project â€” but it points toward a different future for AI.


## Features

* **Ephemeral Knowledge:** Answers are generated based on real-time web searches and are not stored.
